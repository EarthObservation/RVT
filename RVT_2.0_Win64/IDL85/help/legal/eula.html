VIS’ option, repair, replacement, or refund of the purchase price of the
Software license, in both cases subject to the condition that any error or
defect constituting a breach of this limited warranty is reported to VIS or the
party supplying the Software to Licensee if different than VIS, within the 60-day
warranty period.  VIS or the party
supplying the Software to Licensee may, at its option, require return of the
Software and/or Documentation as a condition to the remedy. In no event does
VIS warrant that the Software is error free or that Licensee will be able to
operate the Software without problems or interruptions. </p>
