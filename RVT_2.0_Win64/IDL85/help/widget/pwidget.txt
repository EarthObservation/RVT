		PWIDGET - Basic Plotting Widget

PWIDGET is a basic widget to produce simple plots.  It allows easy
customization and annotation via a point-and-click interface.


PWIDGET is called with the vectors to plot as parameters.  N
observations of M variables are displayed with the call:

	PWIDGET, x, y
Where: 
	x = an optional N element parameter, containing the X value of each
		point. 
	y = an (N, M) vector containing the ordinate values for each
		point, for each variable.


The parameter settings may be saved and restored in a structure via
the SAVE and RESTORE keywords.
