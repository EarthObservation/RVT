	XFONT - An IDL Widget for Font Selection

This modal widget allows the selection and viewing of all
the X Window fonts available on the X Window server.

Fonts fall into two classes: Registered and Private.
Registered fonts have been registered with the X Window
consortium and their names follow a defined descriptive
syntax.  Private fonts are server specific and their
names do not follow the font name syntax.

Registered fonts may be selected on the basis of:

  Foundry - The name of the type foundry that
	supplied the font.
  Family - "family" of typeface design.
  Weight - the nominal blackness of the font.  Typical
	values are: bold, light, and normal.
  Slant - R = roman for upright design.
	  I = Italic
	  O = Oblique
  Width - the font's typographic proportionate width:
	  Normal, Condensed, Narrow, or Double Wide.
  Size - the font's point size expressed in decipoints.
	For example, 120 designates a 12 point font.

	font set or the private font set.

DeciPoint Size text widget - (active only if scalable fonts
