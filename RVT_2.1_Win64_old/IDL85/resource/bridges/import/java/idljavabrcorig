#
# IDL Java bridge configuration (Windows)
#
#
# Note: By default, on all platforms except 32-bit Windows, the IDL process
# is run in the same process as the IDL Workbench. In this case, the Java
# Virtual Machine used by the IDL Workbench is also used for the Java bridge,
# and any values set in this file or by any Java environment variables are ignored.
# The only exception is the JVM Classpath, which is still honored.
# To set JVM options to be used by Java bridge processes launched within the
# IDL Workbench, you should add the options to the idlde.ini file in your
# IDL bin directory.
# On 32-bit Windows, the IDL process is separate from the IDL Workbench,
# and all of the settings within this file will apply.



##########################
# Java CLASSPATH setting
##########################
#
#
#    This setting determines how the IDL-Java bridge finds its java classes.
#    It MUST be set in the config file if you wish to find any classes other 
#    than those provided by Java
#
#    If $CLASSPATH appears in the setting (as shown below), the value of 
#    the environment variable $CLASSPATH is substituted in this setting
#
#    Entries in Classpath should be seperated by a semi-colon on Windows
#
#    NOTE: This setting follows the rules of the -classpath option in the java 
#          or javac command,  That is, .jar files should be explicitly stated.  
#          If only a directory location is specified, Java will find .class 
#          files inside this folder but NOT .jar files


# Allow IDL-Java bridge to use .class files located in my CLASSPATH and also the 
# classes found in the examples .jar file shipped with the bridge

JVM Classpath = $CLASSPATH;$JAVABRIDGE_DIR\jbexamples.jar



################################
# Java virtual machine locations
################################
#
#    A 1.6 or later JVM is required.
#
#    These settings control which Java Virtual Machine is started by
#    the IDL-Java Bridge. This is determined as follows:
#
#       1. If 'JVM LibLocation' is set in the config file, this JVM is run.
#
#       2. Otherwise, check the environment variable $IDLJAVAB_LIB_LOCATION.
#          It is the secondary method for setting 'JVM LibLocation'.  If set,
#          this JVM is run.
#
#       3. Else, check the environment variable $JAVA_HOME.  This often points
#          to the top of the current Java SDK.  From this setting, the bridge 
#          attempts to infer a 'good' JVM to run.  It looks for these JVMs in
#          order:
#          classic, hotspot, client, server.
#
#       4. Otherwise, check the JavaSoft registry entries.  
#          If 'Java Development Kit' is set, use the JVM in this SDK
#          (assumes hotspot JVM for Java 1.6 and client JVM for 1.6 and later)
#          Otherwise, if 'Java Runtime Environment' is set, use this JVM.
#
#
#    Sample settings in this config file would look like this:
#
#      JVM LibLocation  = C:\jdk1.6\jre\bin\client


#JVM LibLocation = 


###################
# JVM start options
###################
#
#   'JVM Option#'
#      There may be up to 20 additional JVM options specified.  These 
#      will be used when starting the JVM.  
#
#      NOTE: This is for advanced users only who understand JVM initialization
#
#      For example, a user that wants to reset the initial and maximum memory
#      allocated when the JVM starts, might do something like:
#        JVM Option1 = -Xms4m
#        JVM Option2 = -Xmx16m
#
#      NOTE: These options are unsupported options...thus their effects are 
#            implementation-dependent. It's possible that your implementation 
#            doesn't support them.

###########################
# IDL-Java Bridge debugging 
###########################
#
#
# Some limited debugging is provided via a log file.  
#
# 'Log Location':  Location where log files will be created.  
#                  Log files have format jb_log<pid>.txt
#
# 'Bridge Logging':  Level of debugging information logged to log file.  
#                    Possible options are:
#                    - SEVERE (default, bridge errors logged)
#                    - CONFIG (configuration settings logged)
#                    - CONFIGFINE (configuration settings logged, more detail)

#Log Location = c:/temp/
#Bridge Logging = CONFIG


##############################
# IDL-Java Bridge Reset Policy
##############################
#
# By default, the IDL-Java bridge persists for the duration of the IDL
# session in which it was created. This means that modifications to
# items in the Java Classpath are not loaded until a new IDL session
# is started. This policy allows the IDL-Java bridge to be configured
# to reset when the IDL executive command .FULL_RESET_SESSION is executed.
#
# 'Restart Bridge':  Policy for restarting the IDL-Java bridge.
#                    Possible options are:
#                    - False (Bridge does not reset during an IDL session)
#                    - True  (Bridge resets when the .FULL_RESET_SESSION
#                             executive command is executed)

#Restart Bridge = False
